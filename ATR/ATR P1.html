The world of Irf was in ruins. A once green and mythic world was poluted by an evil force of large immortal soldiers that<br>
had a horrible task which they seek to finish. A war which ended multiple species. But one civilization was left.<br>
<br>
There was a save haven in the middle of a gigantic crater. It was called Morzha Haven with it's own type of people in it<br>
that was called Nitts.<br>

<br>
From all the evil that had happened on the outside, they where happy to stay locked away in their small town.<br>
<br>

<br>
At least 2 siblings, beggars, lived on the cold streets of MossWalk. They where starving without anyone's care. They will<br>
eventually fall apart unless they did something good.<br>
<br>
"I'm tired of starving Nisch..." The boy said. "It's okay Julp..." The girl said.<br>
<br>
<img src="img003.gif"><br>
<br>
"Like ass it's okay! We've done nothing but starve and freeze in the same spot all day!" Julp yelled at his sister these<br>
words and Nisch replied "Well what else can we do? It's not like we're strong enough to survive if we did something at all!<br>
No one is caring enough to help us Julp.."<br>
<br>
"I just.." Julp tried to say.<br>
<br>
<img src="img004.gif"><br>
<br>
"I don't feel like dying Nisch. I don't think we deserve to go like this." He said. Then Nisch said "What do you expect us<br>
to do? We haven't got a single pent from our parent's treasure and people probably think we're diseased. We're nothing but<br>
animals now Julp..."<br>
<br>
<img src="img005.gif"><br>
<br>
...!<br>
<br>
<img src="img006.gif"><br>
<br>
"Or.. Maybe if we're lucky we'll get some food by time! Never give up after all!"<br>
<br>
Julp wasn't so sure about what his sister said to him since she always draws a positive thought out to him and nothing has<br>
changed afterwards. They're still in a negative position and always was in that.<br>
<br>
"It doesn't work like that Nisch." Julp said and continued "We don't get anything by standing still. We must get a job somehow."<br>
<br>
<br>
Nisch's mood went back to desperation and said "What jobs can we have? I doubt that I can use any tools or weapons for anything<br>
like a job." Julp replied "Me neither.. But you might have more use with your body than any..."<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img007.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
"Wait.. What do you mean by using my 'body'?" Nisch interrupted. "Nothing.. Nevermind.." Julp said.<br>
<br>
<br>
Julp's job idea got him thinking about something. "Maybe.. We can make our own job?"<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img008.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
"I'm sorry brother but it's a lot harder to start a business than you think. It requires money, time..."<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img009.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
"That's not what I meant. Should have been more precise on what I said to you."<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img010.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
"We will craft our own job ourselves. To prove that we are worth everyone's time. Then we can get what we need!" Julp said<br>
with a smile. "What job do you think we should do then?" Nisch replied in question.<br>
<br>
"I don't know yet. But we can figure out one if we use both our heads." Julp said.<br>

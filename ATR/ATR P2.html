"Fuck it. Let's leave this area and find something to eat."<br>
<br>
<br>
"We can always try later can we?" Nisch said to her give-up brother. "We're more lucky finding something edible in the junk<br>
than coming up with a job Nisch!" Julp replied.<br>
<br>
<br>
Whilst the twins searched for some edible junk, Nisch found a poster for something interesting.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img014.gif"><br>
<br>
"Brother! Look at this!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img015.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
"The name Rio seems familiar to me.." Nisch said. "Me too actually.." Julp replied.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img016.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
"Wait! I remember! He's the guy that arranged those lotteries in the past!"<br>
Julp said in an alert "You don't need to scream that to me Nisch!"<br>
<br>
Nisch kept talking exitingly "It's tommorrow! We can join in and get money from it!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img017.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
"Nisch! I'm sorry but we can't go to any lotteries." Julp replied getting Nisch calm who asked "Why not?". Julp replied <br>
"Cause we got too much to do right now. We're not that lucky to win on a lottery either so forget it."<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img018.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
"And now you're negative again.. Can't we at least try to do it even if we're unlucky?"<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img019.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
"No we can't! It's pointless and a waste of time!" Julp argued. "You always do this when we get an opportunity to regain<br>
a wealth! It's like you want to be homeless! Do you want to live on the streets?!" Nisch argued back. "It's because we always<br>
go back to the same spot after we lose all of it. I'm tired of having things stripped from me and I won't go to any more<br>
lotteries!" Julp said back.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img020.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
"Okay! I'm going to it myself and I will NOT go back to eating trash ever again! You'll hope that I will feel pity and share my<br>
victory with you!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img021.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
So julp stood there watching as his sister walked out of the alley. Wondering if she'll make it in the lottery.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img022.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
Then he remembered that he's hungry and hopes to find something more edible in the trash.<br>

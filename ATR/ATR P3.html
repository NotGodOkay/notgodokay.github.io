Nisch was out of the alley she and her brother were in and was on the way to Rio's lottery. She was again out in the<br>
public which she was not used to.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img024.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
She really doesn't know what she'll encounter from doing this. Let alone with the little clothing she has.<br>
<br>
"Hi Nisch."<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img025.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
"Didn't expect you to come out to the open again. Consumed some delicious junk?"<br>
<br>
Nisch knew who this was. It's her and Julp's old rival Mr Rata.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img026.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
"Get lost Rata! I have no business with you or have time to talk with you either!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img027.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
"Of course not. You don't have the valuta to make business." Rata said. "You're also wasting your time with the lottery<br>
cause you have no chance on joining it."<br>
<br>
"What do you mean by that ugly?" Nisch asked aggressively. "If you want to prevent me from joining it then you'll not<br>
gonna stop me. I have the rights to go!"<br>
<br>
Rata Explained "You will not because you lack the payment for it. Lotteries tend to cost so what do you think you'll give<br>
to go onboard it? Some crap in the alley? You're poor!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img028.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
"You Elkenins where rich for generations and had no issue joining anything! Now when it's over, you can't do anything.."<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img029.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
Then all of a sudden, Julp appeared. "Don't talk like that to my sister Rata. The poster didn't say anything about a price."<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img030.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
"Elkenins was always towering above us Ganters for years, but now it's over! You can't be right about anything anymore<br>
garbage eaters! This lottery is not for free!"<br>
<br>
"It is actually for free!"
<br>
<img src="img031.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
It was Rio who snuk up in the argument. "my lottery was gonna cost too much for anyone so I decided to be a little honest<br>
and make it free for everyone." Rata replied to the sudden info "But that's insanity! You have no rights on doing this!"<br>
<br>
Rio replied back "Yes I have. Business rights doesn't apply to me anymore!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img032.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
"You're the Elkenin twins right? Your father was a good and helpful man that got me out of troubled times. So I will give<br>
his children something as a gratitude for his sacrifices." Rio said nicely to the twins.<br>
<br>
Julp said "Dad was a good man indeed Rio. We forgot that you where his friend from a long time ago." Rio replied "He sure is<br>
Julp! He got me rich after all. Here."<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img033.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
Rio gave Nisch a lottery ticket. They where in the lottery now. "This means a lot to us Rio. We've been poor for years."<br>
Nisch said with a light hearted voice.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img034.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
"Alright then! Give me a ticket Rio. I'm joining in on this as well." Rata said. "Alright then Mr Rata. But I'm still not<br>
happy for what your family did against mine years ago." Rio said giving the rich scumbag a ticket.<br>
<br>
"Is everyone happy with their gifts? Very good. Now I must be off to make sure the workers are doing their job back at the<br>
lottery site. Good luck everyone!" Rio gave these words before leaving the twins and their rival alone.<br>

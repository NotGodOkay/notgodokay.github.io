Nisch was out of the alley she and her brother was in and where on the way to Rio's lottery. She was again out in the<br>
public which she was not used to.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img024.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
She really doesn't know what she'll encounter from doing this. Let alone with the little clothing she has.<br>
<br>
"Hi Nisch."<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
"Didn't expect you to come out to the open again. Consumed some delicious junk?"<br>
<br>
Nisch knew who this was. It's her and Julp's old rival Mr Rata.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
"Get lost Rata! I have no business with you or have time to talk with you either!"<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="img027.gif"><br>
<br>
<br>
"Of course not. You don't have the valuta to make business." Rata said. "You're also wasting your time with the lottery<br>
cause you have no chance on joining it."<br>
<br>
"What do you mean by that ugly?" Nisch asked aggressively. "If you want to prevent me from joining it then you'll not<br>
gonna stop me. I have the rights to go!"<br>
<br>
Rata Explained "You will not because you lack the payment for it. Lotteries tend to cost so what do you think you'll give<br>
to go onboard it? Some crap in the alley? You're poor!"<br>

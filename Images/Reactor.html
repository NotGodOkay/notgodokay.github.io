<p style="text-align:center">Angel-79 and her best invention! The reactor of Tezel Station!<br>
I has some lore in mind for Angel. She was made to make a whole space station on her own and to be an extension of technological science. Her best work was a hyper powered reactor that gives out an extreme amount of power to the station with unusually little energy cost. This might be an interesting process.</p>

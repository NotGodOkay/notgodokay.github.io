A bad day has happened. You got kicked out of your family house by your step-dad and now you are outside with no home or items to<br>
survive on. Plus. You barely know anyone trust worthy in this neighborhood as well.<br>

Time to aimlessly wander until something cool happens
</div><br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0033.gif"><br>
<br>
You're pretty sure that wandering aimlessly would get you in trouble since you don't know which areas are free or off-limits. You're<br>
not even sure if looking at things will get you into trouble!<br>

And this is the problem with little Sockl Wooly. An adult sock who can't live on his own. You're wondering why you're not dead when<br>
you first stepped out to the streets since you're too pathetic to live on your own. All you had and needed was your family and without<br>
it you're nothing. This might as well be the end..<br>
<br>

If you're nothing without a family, make a one.

Try to find a friendly face
</div><br>
<br>
Okay. You feel a bit more confident to try and survive a bit more so maybe you should try and find a familiar face that you can trust.<br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0035.gif"><br>
<br>
"Why isn't it little Sockl?"<br>
SHIT THAT! LET'S MAKE A RUN FOR IT!!<br>

<br>
"Uhm. Excuse me sir. Do you happen to be called Lazlo?"<br>
<br>

<br>
"No my name's Iggy. You must mean the little plush version of myself that I gave you 3 years ago. I admit. I wish I looked like that<br>
instead."<br>

Try and couch surf with Iggy or if he knows anywhere you can work
</div><br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0039.gif"><br>
<br>
Well you might need some sort of job to get afford to buy a couch..<br>

"So you finally got yourself out of Bear-Moodle's grip huh? What a luck. People around was worried about you kid!"<br>
<br>
<div>
llamar said--<br>
Ask which people were worried about you, get some leads!
</div><br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0041.gif"><br>
<br>
"Which people were worried about me?" You ask.<br>
"Most of the neighborhood. Since we figured that Bear was a maniac we started to worry that you might have been abused. Or worse. You<br>
sure are a soldier to still live today." Iggy said.<br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0042.gif"><br>
<br>
You start thinking. Maybe you're in a good place after all?<br>
<br>
<div>
Wiwian said--<br>
explain the predicament you are in with a bit more detail to big Lazlo
</div><br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0043.gif"><br>
<br>
You start talking in detail about what had happened to you for big Lazlo. Or Iggy. About the things that happened and how you feel about<br>
it. You try not to lose focus on it either.<br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0044.gif"><br>
<br>
"Well you have to be glad for getting out though. Everyone where wondering if you where alive at all after all this time. But you can get<br>
a better life outside since you've been released from that abusive crap called Bear-Moodle! I'm sorry for what you've lost never the less<br>
Hopefully you'll get a new family."<br>

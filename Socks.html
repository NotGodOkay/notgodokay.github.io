You're wondering when dinner's coming. Your Step-father didn't tell you when it'll be so you'll try to come up with something fun to do.<br>
<br>
Maybe you should think about who you are or look around the room?<br>
<br>
<br>

Check the toy box

(Squeek!) You love that idea! After all your toys where your friends since your step-father locked you in your room!<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Look here! These are your best friends!<br>
<br>
The blue one with the blanket is called Lazlo. The color cube is called Hybrido. And the rabbid plush is a homeless hobo that you don't<br>
know the name of.<br>
<br>
They where with you for the last 3 years of isolation! A bound was expected to grow between you all!<br>

What does Hybrido do for a living? Seems like a bit of a square

<br>
That's a really good question. You don't know what he does in the toy box but you know for sure that he's a master at existing. And he's<br>
also a god of mind tricks.<br>
<br>
Maybe you shouldn't interfere with his private life. He's the best of the 4 of you after all.<br>

Wiwian said--<br>
what can you tell us about Lazlo
</div><br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0005.gif"><br>
<br>
Lazlo was based of his creator who gave you him when you where depressed. You recal remembering him being called 'Iggy' but that's unclear<br>
since you stayed home for 3 years without going out at all. (Let alone see the sun)<br>
<br>
Lazlo has the same traits as his creator, friendly and talkative. At least that's how Lazlo was so you assume that's how the creator is as<br>
well.<br>

is the bunny doing alright? they don't look very...well

Is the hobo... living?
</div><br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0006.gif"><br>
<br>
Don't worry about him. It's just his eyes that are dead. Perhaps his vocal cords as well since he's mute a lot. It's kinda hard not to feel<br>
sorry for him. The smell he's giving might have killed his nasal passage as well.<br>

Put the rabbit hobo back, i dont like him.

That's very rude to say. But brave. You can't even tell your step-dad to let you out yourself since you're a little sock.<br>

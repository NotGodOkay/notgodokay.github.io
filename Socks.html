You're wondering when dinner's coming. Your Step-father didn't tell you when it'll be so you'll try to come up with something fun to do.<br>
<br>
Maybe you should think about who you are or look around the room?<br>

The blue one with the blanket is called Lazlo. The color cube is called Hybrido. And the rabbid plush is a homeless hobo that you don't<br>
know the name of.<br>
<br>
They where with you for the last 3 years of isolation! A bound was expected to grow between you all!<br>

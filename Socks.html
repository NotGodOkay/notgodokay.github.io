Socks Works. A comic about socks!

<br>
You're wondering when dinner's coming. Your Step-father didn't tell you when it'll be so you'll try to come up with something fun to do.<br>
<br>
Maybe you should think about who you are or look around the room?<br>
<br>
<br>
<div>
Gabriel said--<br>
Check the toy box
</div><br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0002.gif"><br>
(Squeek!) You love that idea! After all your toys where your friends since your step-father locked you in your room!<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0003.gif"><br>
<br>
Look here! These are your best friends!<br>
<br>
The blue one with the blanket is called Lazlo. The color cube is called Hybrido. And the rabbid plush is a homeless hobo that you don't<br>
know the name of.<br>
<br>
They where with you for the last 3 years of isolation! A bound was expected to grow between you all!<br>
<br>

gorbino said--<br>
Look at the fourth wall
</div><br>
<br>
There's nothing there..<br>
<br>
<br>
<div>
loomhigh said--<br>
What does Hybrido do for a living? Seems like a bit of a square
</div><br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0004.gif"><br>
<br>
That's a really good question. You don't know what he does in the toy box but you know for sure that he's a master at existing. And he's<br>
also a god of mind tricks.<br>
<br>
Maybe you shouldn't interfere with his private life. He's the best of the 4 of you after all.<br>
<br>
<br>
<div>
Wiwian said--<br>
what can you tell us about Lazlo
</div><br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0005.gif"><br>
<br>
Lazlo was based of his creator who gave you him when you where depressed. You recal remembering him being called 'Iggy' but that's unclear<br>
since you stayed home for 3 years without going out at all. (Let alone see the sun)<br>
<br>
Lazlo has the same traits as his creator, friendly and talkative. At least that's how Lazlo was so you assume that's how the creator is as<br>
well.<br>
<br>
<br>
<div>
Wiwian said--<br>
is the bunny doing alright? they don't look very...well
</div><br>
<br>
<div>
Lightecho said--<br>
Is the hobo... living?
</div><br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0006.gif"><br>
<br>
Don't worry about him. It's just his eyes that are dead. Perhaps his vocal cords as well since he's mute a lot. It's kinda hard not to feel<br>
sorry for him. The smell he's giving might have killed his nasal passage as well.<br>
<br>
<br>

glizzy lizzy said--<br>
Put the rabbit hobo back, i dont like him.
</div><br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0007.gif"><br>
That's very rude to say. But brave. You can't even tell your step-dad to let you out yourself since you're a little sock.<br>
<br>
<br>
<div>
Gorgonzola said--<br>
Are there more toys in the cupboard?
</div><br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0008.gif"><br>
<br>
No. There's no toys in there since it's not meant for it, there's actually nothing in it but dust and empty space. But you can still play<br>
games with it like pretending to be dead in it. Always fun to do actually.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0009.gif"><br>
<br>
Dad's been taking some time with the cooking today. You wonder what's taking so long.<br>
<br>
<br>
<div>
Katia said--<br>
Nothing out of the ordinary has happened. Youâ€™re sure Dad is fine.
</div><br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0010.gif"><br>
<br>
You're definitely sure of that. He's a very muscular bear so of course he's healthy and fine.<br>
<br>
Maybe he's cooking Asothils for you? Those can take some time to do but he usually doesn't make that often.<br>
<br>
<br>
<div>
john eldenring said--<br>
play elden ring
</div><br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0011.gif"><br>
<br>
But you don't have an old ring. Or what did the voice in your head mean by that? The Lord Of The Rings?<br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0012.gif"><br>
<br>
You might need to think about something else instead. Maybe your past crush? Something at least. You don't know.<br>
<br>
<br>
<div>
Capes said--<br>
what do you mean past crush, why would you crush something? were you angry?
</div><br>
<br>
No no, not that type of 'crush'. You where in love with another sock.<br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0013.gif"><br>
<br>
After everything you remembered, she's the one you think of the most. Her name's Ribbi Sock. She was an artist and is also the prettiest<br>
girl you've ever seen in your life! You might not remember how she looked like mostly but you saw an angel walk on mortal ground for<br>
sure!<br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0014.gif"><br>
<br>
But what about you? How can you have the chance to get Ribbi when you're you? It's been years as well so maybe she's gotten someone else<br>
to care for her? 3 years in your room. Only allowed to get out when it's dinner time. Sometimes.<br>
<br>
<div>
John Determination said--<br>
You need a super good plan to find Ribbi Sock and confess your love.
</div><br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0015.gif"><br>
<br>
You wished it worked like that a couple of times. But you're really not the one to disobey your step-dad and go outside on your own free<br>
will. But thanks for being a determined voice.<br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0016.gif"><br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0017.gif"><br>
<br>
Speaking of dad.. Your step-father is here..<br>
<br>
"Hi dad!" You said. "Come with me Sockl." He said in his usual deep voice. <br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0018.gif"><br>
<br>
"Um.. Okay...?" You said. Dad doesn't say your real name that much at all. He mostly calls you 'Boy' or 'Runt'. Did you do something wrong<br>
again?<br>
<br>
<div>
Self preservation said--<br>
OH MY GOD HE'S A PITBULL ABSCOND OUTTA THERE!<br>
<br>
ABORT, ABORT!
</div><br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0019.gif"><br>
<br>
No need to panic. He might look odd but you knew him ever since he married your mother so he's not dangerous.<br>
<br>
Also he's some sort of Bear-thing-something. No need to worry, this is all normal.<br>
<br>
<br>
<div>
Gorblno said--<br>
He's probably mad because you failed to notice the door on the fourth wall!
</div><br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0020.gif"><br>
<br>
That's actually a locked safe. Dad keeps his medicin there. Or whatever it is.<br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0021.gif"><br>
<br>
Anyway. There's nothing to worry about. Infact. He's your protector! He wouldn't hurt you or even let someone else do that either like if<br>
he was to-<br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0022.gif"><br>
<br>
Take.. In a stranger to your home...<br>
<br>
Your dad said "Sockl, this is Mary." and you greeted the strange couch woman "Hi Mary! I'm-"<br>
<br>
<img src="Socks/img0023.gif"><br>
<br>
"Don't talk to me you fag!" Mary said. "Don't talk to her Sockl." Dad said to you.<br>
<br>
You where clueless about what to do now..<br>

A bad day has happened. You got kicked out of your family house by your step-dad and now you are outside with no home or items to<br>
survive on. Plus. You barely know anyone trust worthy in this neighborhood as well.<br>

Time to aimlessly wander until something cool happens

You're pretty sure that wandering aimlessly would get you in trouble since you don't know which areas are free or off-limits. You're<br>
not even sure if looking at things will get you into trouble!<br>

And this is the problem with little Sockl Wooly. An adult sock who can't live on his own. You're wondering why you're not dead when<br>
you first stepped out to the streets since you're too pathetic to live on your own. All you had and needed was your family and without<br>
it you're nothing. This might as well be the end..<br>

If you're nothing without a family, make a one.

Try to find a friendly face
</div><br>
<br>
Okay. You feel a bit more confident to try and survive a bit more so maybe you should try and find a familiar face that you can trust.<br>

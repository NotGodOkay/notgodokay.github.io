Word 1 : Returning<br>
Even if it's common and fun it's not good for you. I am entirely sure on that. I'm returning often to this and it's hurting my brain. I don't want to be this way. But I half know my place on the internet. And it's not to be a happy place either. It's obvious where I'm going from all this. Another unhappy place.<br>
<br>
How come you want to follow your addiction? You know from the inside that all of it is bad but you can't stop with it. You're just having a really good time doing it while your body kills itself. Maybe it's not addiction? Maybe you're just evil and selfish? Maybe both?

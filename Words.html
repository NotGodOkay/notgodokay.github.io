<p> Words 1: The fuck that I what</p>
<p>One night in the past I had a dream. I will share it here with you now as<br>
I always wanted to. Though I didn't remember the beginning, I remembered the<br>
end really well. I was told by some small, very tiny human beings, probably<br>
a group of Homunculuses, to help them get somewhere or achieve something that<br>
involved me. So I took them up with my hand and went on a crazy adventure. They<br>
all died on my hand so I dropped their dead bodies and went to the nearest<br>
church where a group of people did something religious. In there I sat next<br>
to a somewhat goth-like girl that I talked to, we probably talked gibberish to<br>
each others. Then she lied down on her stomach, I opened her buttocks up like<br>
a split door, it looked all fleshy inside, I put my dick inside and closed her<br>
ass cheeks and then I woke up.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if this was the strangest my dreams has come up with but it's a<br>
rememberable piece of consciousness.<br>

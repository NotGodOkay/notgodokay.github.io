Word 1 : Returning<br>
Even if it's common and fun it's not good for you. I am entirely sure on that. I'm returning often to this and it's hurting my brain. I don't want to be this way. But I half know my place on the internet. And it's not to be a happy place either. It's obvious where I'm going from all this. Another unhappy place.<br>
<br>
How come you want to follow your addiction? You know from the inside that all of it is bad but you can't stop with it. You're just having a really good time doing it while your body kills itself. Maybe it's not addiction? Maybe you're just evil and selfish? Maybe both?

Word 2 : Felt A-lot Better<br>
Was awhile now was it? Makes sense since I start believing in a better future for me now. This is still a horror site so I'm going to try keep it that way while still being in a good mood.

Word 3 : A Real Brutal Album<br>
Let me put up an album that I'm listening to a lot recently while thinking my dark thoughts.<br>
<a href="https://little-sap-dungeon.bandcamp.com/album/silent-entities">Silent Entities by Little Sap Dungeon</a><br>
Take a listen. It will surprise you on levels that I thought was forbidden.
